# Arad_Project
Data mining and Analyzing : Shaler Medical Emergency Center  

In this project, we analyzed the whole data collected during 10 years by the staff of the Emergency Center of ARAD.
The raw data that we received was re-organized and analyzed.
We present the distribution of diseases and patients following age, and date of treatment. 
Thanks to the work we are able to show trends of patients' complaints thorough the years. 
The large amount of data - more then 65k files - allows to draw sagnificant conclusions.
